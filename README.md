# Genomeanalysis

This is my Lab project repository for the course Genome Analysis spring 2020 at Uppsala University. I worked with the draft genome for fruit Durian.

The following is the structured way for better understanding of my repository:

Scripts -  All of my bioinformatics tools that are performed in the bash scripts during the analysis.

Raw Data - Softlinks that I created and used during this course, also contains the 49 genes provided by the authors of the paper.

Results Images - The results that are obtained during the analysis and the screenshots of results.

Project Introduction - The whole detail copy of the paper 5 in pdf format. 

WIKI page will provide the complete insights of the project.
